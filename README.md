# ec2runner script to start, stop instances and manage snaps
Build with :heart:

AWS: Manage AWS Ec2 instance snapshots, start and stop instances, display the list of instances along with volumes and snapshots.

## About:pencil2:

This project uses boto3 to manage AWS EC2 instances and snapshots.

ec2runner uses the configuration file created by the AWS cli. e.g.

`aws configure --profile ec2runner`

code is never finished only abandoned :art:
### How to package your code 
Install setup tools with -d since you only need it for development
`pipevn install -d setuptools`

Next we create a `setup.py` file.
`setup.py` file essentially tells setuptools how to build your package
It does this by creating a function called setup

here is the `setup.py` file

```
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="ec2runner-2018",
    version="2018-11-01-0.1",
    author="Dariush Azimi",
    author_email="my email addr",
    description="ec2runner-2018 is a tool to manage AWS EC2 snapshots, list,stop,start intances and show related volumes",
    license="GPLv3+",
    packages=['ec2runner'],
    url="https://github.com/dariushazimi/ec2runner",
    install_requires=[
        'click',
        'boto3'
    ],
    entry_points='''
        [console_scripts]
        ec2runner=ec2runner.ec2runner:cli
        '''

)
```
Save the file.
Next we need to generate a wheel file
Here is how to create the wheel file

` pipenv run python setup.py bdist_wheel`

Take a look inside the dist folder
`ls -al dist`

The wheel file is a python code that lets your script run
Now that we have the package we can install it like any other package `pip3 install ec2runner_2018-2018_11_01_0.1-py3-none-any.whl`

To see that is installed on your system do:
`pip3 show ec2runner-2018`

Now you can run 
` ec2runner instances list`

Now that you have the wheel file you can install it on any machine that has python3, even windows.
All done in a few simple steps
